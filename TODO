- There is a lot of heartbeat overhead. See if we can reduce that.
- Get ssh extension mode to be compatible with ssh multiplexing so
  it only requires a single gnubby touch.
- Reset TERM if someone reattaches from a new terminal type.
- Reload config if we get a SIGHUP
- Implement spooling logic to handle subprocesses which generate
  a bunch of output after we have detached.
- Fix echo bug in ssh plugin mode. For some reason the tty echo seems
  to work differently for ssh plugin mode, so we see commands twice if
  we enable echo for the pty as normal. Disabling pty echo
  explicitly helps a bit, but we still get double newlines for some reason.
- allow people to gcert inside a shpool session by plumbing SSH_AUTH_SOCK
  in from the client environment (possibly by adding some config options to
  the toml file so users can control which env vars get forwarded or
  possibly by copying what tmux does with its update-environment subcommand).
  See go/sk-screen-tmux for more details.


There is a cool pair of signals that might be useful for dealing with IO
from the shell after a network drop. SIGTIN/SIGTOUT suspend a background
process if they try to read or write to the termianl. It causes them
to pause and wait for a SIGCONT just like ^Z does. This might present an
alternative approach instead of spooling the output.
