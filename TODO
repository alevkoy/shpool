- There is a lot of heartbeat overhead. See if we can reduce that.
- Reload config if we get a SIGHUP
- Implement spooling logic to handle subprocesses which generate
  a bunch of output after we have detached.
- Fix echo bug in ssh plugin mode. For some reason the tty echo seems
  to work differently for ssh plugin mode, so we see commands twice if
  we enable echo for the pty as normal. Disabling pty echo
  explicitly helps a bit, but we still get double newlines for some reason.
- Add a keybinding for detaching. Make it simpler than tmux or screen since
  this will be the only keybinding. Make it configurable in the toml file
  with at least enough flexibility to allow tmux users to use their normal
  "C-a d" keybinding.
- SIGWINCH appears to redraw the shell prompt some of the time, but not
  always on reconnect https://screencast.googleplex.com/cast/NjM5ODM3MzQ1MzEwMzEwNHwzZTRiNjJmYy1iNg shows the problem.
  - This might be fixed after I got SIGWINCH to start working for emacs. Let's
    wait to see if other people report improvement.
- Shpool introduces more lag than it should http://screencast/cast/NjU4Nzk0MTA3MDU2OTQ3MnxkYzhmZjhhZS00Nw
- I should set up CI/CD (can probably let Nicholas figure it out then copy him)
- I should do some security hardening (the cidermux docs have some good suggestions here)
- Add a -f option to the attach command which forcibly detaches sessions before
  attaching to them in case a session still has a client attached. (Use this option
  in the roadwarrior integration)
- Exit with a success error code when a session gets manually detached (either
  via shpool detach or with the upcoming detach keybinding).
