- Get ssh extension mode to work for reconnect. Currently it only works
  for the initial connection.
- Get ssh extension mode to be compatible with ssh multiplexing so
  it only requires a single gnubby touch.
```
Host = ct-shpool
    Hostname pailes.c.googlers.com

    # enable ssh multiplexing so that we only need one gnubby touch
    #
    # TODO(ethan): this seems to cause trouble because the LocalCommand
    #              does not work when I have multiplexing enabled.
    #
    # ControlPath ~/.ssh/sudp-cm-%r@%h:%p
    # ControlMaster auto
    # ControlPersist 10m # stay open after the initial conn closes for 10m

    #RemoteCommand echo remote
    PermitLocalCommand yes
    LocalCommand ssh -oPermitLocalCommand=no -oRemoteCommand="/usr/local/google/home/pailes/bin/shpool -vv --log-file /tmp/shpool-ssh-local-command-set-name.log plumbing ssh-local-command-set-name '%u@%h:%p$(tty)'" %n
```




- make sure the inner lock is a correctly released when the client exists
- forward Ctrl-C to the inner shell correctly
- come up with some sort of keybinding to exit the shpool shell.
  make it configurable via the daemon's toml file.
- Pass TERM along so that `reset` works
- make a centralized chunk writing thread so that writes do not
  get interleaved for data coming from the daemon to the client.
