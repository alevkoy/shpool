- There is a lot of heartbeat overhead. See if we can reduce that.
- Implement spooling logic to handle subprocesses which generate
  a bunch of output after we have detached.
- Exit with a success error code when a session gets manually detached (either
  via shpool detach or with the upcoming detach keybinding).
- Allow users to specify a command to run instead of their default shell.
   - Note that the way ssh does this is by doing [shell, "-c", command_string]
     for argv, so it seems like shells all need to support "-c" in order to work
     with sshd. Seems like a safe bet to just do the same thing.
- Call `setsid()` (`man 2 setsid`) in the fork child before exec. This creates
  a fresh new session id for the shell, which is importaint for stuff like
  making sure that a sudo invocation only provides elevated priviledges for
  that shell, not all other shells spawned by shpool.

  good explaination.
