- try to figure out how to disable test hooks at compile time
  for non-test builds (and get the binaries used by the tests
  to actually be built with the test flag) (or maybe just
  send the SIGWINCH sourselves instead of relying on the pty
  doing it for us when we resize it).
- Try fixing the fact that SIGWINCH doesn't always seem to work
  on reconnect to a vim session by making the pty one column bigger
  and then the right size to try to force a redraw.
- come up with some sort of keybinding to exit the shpool shell.
  make it configurable via the daemon's toml file. (Or maybe just
  make users use commands to do this? That won't work for long running
  processes though).
- There is a lot of heartbeat overhead. See if we can reduce that.
- Get ssh extension mode to be compatible with ssh multiplexing so
  it only requires a single gnubby touch.
- Reset TERM if someone reattaches from a new terminal type.
- Reload config if we get a SIGHUP


There is a cool pair of signals that might be useful for dealing with IO
from the shell after a network drop. SIGTIN/SIGTOUT suspend a background
process if they try to read or write to the termianl. It causes them
to pause and wait for a SIGCONT just like ^Z does. This might present an
alternative approach instead of spooling the output.
