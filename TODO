- There is a lot of heartbeat overhead. See if we can reduce that.
- Implement spooling logic to handle subprocesses which generate
  a bunch of output after we have detached.
- Add a keybinding for detaching. Make it simpler than tmux or screen since
  this will be the only keybinding. Make it configurable in the toml file
  with at least enough flexibility to allow tmux users to use their normal
  "C-a d" keybinding.
- Exit with a success error code when a session gets manually detached (either
  via shpool detach or with the upcoming detach keybinding).
- Allow users to specify a command to run instead of their default shell.
